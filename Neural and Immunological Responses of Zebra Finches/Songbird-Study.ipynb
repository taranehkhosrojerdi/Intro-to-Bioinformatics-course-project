        "#### Investigating the Influence of Social Environment on Neural Responses to Sickness in Zebra Finches: A Bioinformatics Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "The Zebra Finch, _Taeniopygia guttata_, a widely used model organism in behavioral and neurobiological research, provides an excellent platform to study the interplay between social environment, neural function, and immune response. In this project, we delve into an intriguing scientific question: How does the social environment of these birds modulate their neural response to immune challenges?\n",
        "\n",
        "This question was explored in a study by Lopes PC, Faber-Hammond JJ, Siemonsma C, Patel S, and Renn SCP, titled _\"The social environment alters neural responses to a lipopolysaccharide challenge\"_ (Brain Behav Immun 2023). Their research demonstrated that the social environment, particularly the presence of conspecifics, could significantly modulate the neural responses of Zebra Finches to immune challenges such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecule known to induce immune responses. Link to Paper\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal in this notebook is to revisit and build upon the findings of this study. Using RNA sequencing data from their research, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of changes in gene expression across different brain regions of Zebra Finches under different social conditions. We will specifically focus on the hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the nucleus taeniae, all of which are key regions for understanding behavior and immune response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The essence of this project is to draw meaningful insights from high-dimensional data. We encourage you to start with basic approaches and gradually build complexity. Remember, every effort to extract information and gain insights from the data is valuable and will be recognized. Approach the tasks with curiosity and an open mind, and let your analytical journey be both informative and enjoyable.\n",

        "\n",
        "The primary aim of this high-throughput sequencing study was to discern how different social environments could modulate the neural response to sickness induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)** is a large molecule consisting of a lipid and a polysaccharide, found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is often referred to as an endotoxin due to its ability to trigger strong immune responses. When a Gram-negative bacterium dies, it releases its LPS, which can then find its way into the bloodstream. In the context of this study, LPS was used to simulate an immune challenge or sickness in the Zebra Finches.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Experimental Setup:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment involved male Zebra Finches, which were administered either an LPS injection to simulate sickness or a control solution. Following the injection, the birds were placed in one of four distinct social contexts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Isolated (ISO)**: In this setting, the birds were kept alone without a female. This condition was designed to examine the neural and immune responses of the birds in the absence of any social interactions. This group helps to understand the baseline responses to the LPS challenge when there are no social factors at play.\n",
        "- **Known Female Continuous (KFC)**: Here, the birds were continuously housed with a known female. This condition allowed the researchers to investigate the effects of a stable social environment on the birds' responses to the LPS challenge. This group can provide insights into how ongoing social interactions might influence the response to sickness.\n",
        "- **Known Female Reunited (KF)**: In this scenario, the birds were reunited with a known female after a period of separation. This condition was intended to mimic the effects of a disrupted social environment followed by a reunion. This group can shed light on how changes in social relationships might affect the neural and immune responses to sickness.\n",
        "- **Novel Female (NF)**: In this context, the birds were paired with a previously unknown female. This condition was designed to explore the effects of introducing a new social partner on the birds' responses to the LPS challenge. This group can reveal how novel social encounters might modulate the response to sickness.\n",
        "\n",
        "These social settings were carefully chosen to represent a range of social interactions that the birds might encounter in their natural habitats. The experimental design allows for a comprehensive investigation of how social environment influences the neural responses to sickness, thereby improving our understanding of how the social environment can affect health.\n",

        "### Understanding RNA-Seq\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing) is a powerful technique that uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA molecules in a biological sample. It provides a snapshot of gene expression, also known as the transcriptome.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is RNA-Seq?**\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq allows us to investigate and discover the transcriptome, which is the total cellular content of RNAs including mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA. Understanding the transcriptome is key if we are to connect the information in our genome with its functional protein expression. RNA-Seq can tell us which genes are turned on in a cell, what their level of transcription is, and at what times they are activated or shut off. This allows scientists to understand the biology of a cell more deeply and assess changes that may indicate disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How does RNA-Seq work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The RNA-Seq workflow has several steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **RNA extraction**: The first step involves extracting the total RNA from the sample.\n",
        "2. **Reverse transcription into cDNA**: The extracted RNA is then converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) through a process called reverse transcription.\n",
        "3. **Library preparation**: The cDNA is then used to prepare a sequencing library. This involves fragmenting the cDNA, adding sequencing adapters, and amplifying the library.\n",
        "4. **Sequencing**: The prepared library is then sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RNA-Seq Data**\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of an RNA-Seq experiment is a large set of short DNA sequences, or reads. These reads can be aligned to a reference genome to determine which genes were being transcribed at the time the sample was collected. The number of reads aligning to a particular gene provides a measure of that gene's expression level.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RNA-Seq vs Microarrays**\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq has several advantages over microarray technology, a legacy technology often used in gene expression studies. Unlike microarrays, which require species- or transcript-specific probes, RNA-Seq does not require any prior knowledge about the sequences of the transcripts. This allows RNA-Seq to detect novel transcripts, gene fusions, single nucleotide variants, indels (small insertions and deletions), and other previously unknown changes. RNA-Seq also has a wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity compared to microarrays, making it better at detecting transcripts and specifically isoforms.\n",

        "**Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Why is it important to convert RNA into cDNA for RNA-Seq? What would happen if we tried to sequence RNA directly?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are different reasons why converting RNA to cDNA is better. The common and efficient PCR procoess, is defined for amplification of DNA fragments,a allowing for the generation of sufficient quantities of DNA for downstream sequencing. This amplification step is necessary because RNA molecules are typically present in low abundance within a cell, especially mRNA (messenger RNA), which is the primary target of RNA-Seq.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, RNA is inherently less stable than DNA due to its single-stranded nature and susceptibility to degradation by RNases (ribonucleases). cDNA, on the other hand, is more stable and less prone to degradation, making it suitable for long-term storage and manipulation in the laboratory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, RNA is inherently less stable than DNA due to its single-stranded nature and susceptibility to degradation by RNases (ribonucleases). cDNA, on the other hand, is more stable and less prone to degradation, making it suitable for long-term storage and manipulation in the laboratory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does the process of preparing a sequencing library contribute to the accuracy of RNA-Seq results? What are some potential sources of error in this step?\n",
        "\n",
        "Sequencing libraries provide replication adapters for us. Sequencing adapters are ligated to the ends of the cDNA fragments to facilitate their amplification and sequencing. Proper and efficient ligation of adapters is crucial for successful library construction.\n",
        "Incomplete or inefficient ligation can result in the loss of sequencing reads, leading to decreased sequencing depth and coverage, and potentially biased representation of transcripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improper fragmentation or size selection can lead to biased representation of certain transcripts, resulting in inaccurate gene expression measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In multiplexed RNA-Seq experiments, unique barcode sequences (indexes) are incorporated into the adapters to distinguish between different samples. Accurate indexing is essential to assign sequencing reads to their respective samples correctly. Index hopping, where reads are misassigned to incorrect samples due to index misreads or PCR errors, can lead to cross-contamination between samples and inaccurate quantification of gene expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "The accurate quantification of the library concentration is crucial for sequencing to ensure optimal loading and sequencing depth. Inaccurate library quantification can lead to over- or under-representation of samples during sequencing, affecting the evenness of coverage and the ability to detect low-abundance transcripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How does the ability of RNA-Seq to detect novel transcripts contribute to our understanding of gene function? Can you think of a scenario where this capability would be particularly useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability of RNA-Seq to detect novel transcripts significantly contributes to our understanding of gene function by uncovering previously unknown or unannotated RNA molecules. This capability enables researchers to discover new genes, alternative splice isoforms, non-coding RNAs, and other transcriptional events that may play important roles in cellular processes and biological functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq can reveal the presence of transcripts originating from genomic regions that were previously unrecognized as genes. These novel transcripts may encode proteins with undiscovered functions or serve as regulatory elements influencing gene expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq can detect alternative splicing events, where different combinations of exons are included or excluded from the mature mRNA transcripts. This diversity in splicing patterns can generate multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene, expanding the functional repertoire of the genome.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq can detect alternative splicing events, where different combinations of exons are included or excluded from the mature mRNA transcripts. This diversity in splicing patterns can generate multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene, expanding the functional repertoire of the genome.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq allows for the identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which do not encode proteins but play crucial roles in gene regulation, RNA processing, and other cellular functions. Examples include long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Why might a researcher choose to use RNA-Seq instead of microarrays for a gene expression study? What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of each method?\n",
        "\n",
        "RNA-Seq has a broader dynamic range and higher sensitivity compared to microarrays, allowing for the detection of low-abundance transcripts and subtle changes in gene expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, RNA-Seq can identify novel transcripts, alternative splicing events, and non-coding RNAs without prior knowledge of their sequences. In contrast, microarrays rely on predefined probes and may miss transcripts that are not represented on the array.\n",

        "In this RNA-Seq dataset, we delve into the complex world of the Zebra Finch by examining gene expression in three distinct areas of the brain: the hypothalamus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the nucleus taeniae. Each of these regions plays a unique role in bird behavior and physiology.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The Hypothalamus** (HY samples): This region is crucial for controlling hormones and basic survival functions like feeding, fighting, fleeing, and reproduction.\n",
        "- **The Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis** (NST samples): This area is involved in the bird's stress response and emotional behavior.\n",
        "- **The Nucleus Taeniae** (TN samples): An area of the brain unique to birds, thought to be involved in social behaviors and possibly song learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "These regions were likely chosen for their significant roles in behaviors that are crucial for survival and species-specific activities. By analyzing gene expression in these areas, researchers can gain insights into how these regions contribute to the unique behaviors of the Zebra Finch.\n",

The columns, labeled with codes like `HY3`, `HY4`, `NST3`, etc., correspond to samples from these three brain regions. The numbers are read counts, indicating how often each gene's RNA was detected in the sample. High numbers suggest a gene is very active in that sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "These numbers are crucial. They tell us how active each gene was in each sample. The higher the number, the more active the gene. By comparing these numbers across different samples, we can get insights into how gene activity varies in different situations or conditions.\n",

In this context, it corrects for variations in sequencing depth and gene length across samples, enabling accurate comparisons of gene expression levels. Without normalization, differences in read counts could be mistakenly attributed to biological variation instead of technical biases.\n",

        "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a crucial protein involved in the growth, survival, and differentiation of neurons. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and is essential for learning and memory.\n",
        "The BDNF gene provides instructions for making a protein found in the brain and spinal cord called brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This protein promotes the survival of neurons by playing a role in the growth, maturation (differentiation), and maintenance of these cells. In the brain, the BDNF protein is active at the connections between nerve cells (synapses), where cell-to-cell communication occurs. The synapses can change and adapt over time in response to experience, a characteristic called synaptic plasticity. The BDNF protein helps regulate synaptic plasticity, which is important for learning and memory.\n",
        "So in general, expression of this gene helps the activity of neurons in brain. The expression of this gene in different areas of brain are affected by different stimulants.\n",
        "As we see, the birds united with known female have highest expression of this gene, which suggests the better neuronal function. On the other hand, isolated birds have the lowest value of this gene expression, so social status can seriously affect the brain activity through this gene expression.\n",
        "On the other hand, using LPS increases gene expression in some special tisues according to the need, so we see that the upper range increases in L group.\n",
        "In conclusion, this plot shows serious correlation between social status and brain activity."

        "A comprehensive exploration of gene expression data requires a multifaceted visualization approach. Beyond the boxplot, we will delve into additional techniques that can bring forth deeper insights from our dataset. You are tasked with implementation and interpretation of the results of at least one of the following visualization methods:\n",

        "- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: This technique reduces the dimensionality of the data and can reveal the underlying structure by capturing the most variation across samples.\n",
        "- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, t-SNE can help identify clusters of genes or samples.\n",

        "In RNA-Seq data, high dimensionality (a large number of genes) presents several analytical challenges. This complexity can obscure meaningful biological insights and impact the statistical power of our analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges of High Dimensionality**:\n",
        "1. **Statistical Power Loss**: With too many variables (genes), the risk of finding false positives increases, known as the 'multiple testing problem'.\n",
        "2. **Overfitting Risk**: High-dimensional data can lead to models that are too complex, capturing noise rather than true underlying patterns.\n",
        "3. **Computational Intensity**: Analyzing thousands of genes simultaneously demands significant computational resources and time.\n",

        "**Addressing These Challenges**:\n",
        "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) help in reducing the number of dimensions, making the data more manageable and revealing hidden structures.\n",
        "2. **RNA-Seq Specific Tools for DGE Analysis**: Tools like DESeq2 and edgeR (available in Python through rpy2 or similar interfaces) are designed to handle high-dimensional data. They offer:\n",
        "   - **Normalization and Variance Stabilization**: Tailored for RNA-Seq data, ensuring fair comparisons across samples.\n",
        "   - **FDR Control**: Implement procedures to adjust for multiple comparisons, reducing false positives.\n",

        "**Python Implementation**:\n",
        "- In python environments, the use of R-based tools like DESeq2 or edgeR is possible through interfaces such as `rpy2`. This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of these tools while working within a Python framework. However, as stated multiple times in this project, you have freedom to choose alternative method for any task, as long as it makes sense.\n",
