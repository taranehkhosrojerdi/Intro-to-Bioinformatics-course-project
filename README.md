This repository contains codes and documents for the course "Introduction to Bioinformatics" final project. This project contains different tasks with different learning aims.
**Tasks overview:**
**1-Find The Imposter:**
This task consists assemblying a given dataset of short reads using Galaxy tools, and using BLAST search for the assembled genome. The results are then analyzed and different plots are provided for the analysis.

**2-Comparative Analysis of Mitochondrial Genomes:**
This task focuses on understanding evoloutionary relationships between species using mitochondrial genome alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and exploration and anthropological insights.

**3-Neural and Immunological Responses of Zebra Finches:**
The goal in this task is to the influence of social environment on neural responses to sickness in Zebra Finches using methods of data processing, gene expression analysis, functional annotation and also some interpertation in the context of neurobiology, immunology, and social behavior.
